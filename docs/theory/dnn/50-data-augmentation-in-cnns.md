# Data augmentation in CNNs

A CNN with 25 million parameters trained on 10,000 images will memorize the training set. Data augmentation applies random transformations to training images at each epoch, so the model never sees the exact same image twice. This artificially multiplies the effective dataset size, forces the model to learn transformation-invariant features, and acts as a powerful regularizer.

## One-line definition

Data augmentation applies random label-preserving transformations to training images to increase effective dataset size and reduce overfitting.

![CNN feature maps — data augmentation forces each of these features to be learned from all positions and orientations, not just as memorized patterns](https://cs231n.github.io/assets/cnn/weights.jpeg)
*Source: [CS231n — Convolutional Neural Networks](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) (Stanford) — augmentation makes each filter more general by exposing it to all image variations*

## Why augmentation works

A cat is still a cat if it is:
- Horizontally flipped
- Slightly rotated
- Cropped differently
- Slightly brighter or darker

If the model sees the cat in all these forms during training, it learns to be invariant to these transformations. Without augmentation, the model memorizes the exact training images and fails on any variation. Augmentation encodes our domain knowledge about what transformations preserve the label.

## Standard geometric augmentations

```python
from torchvision import transforms

geometric_augmentations = transforms.Compose([
    # Random crop: forces the model to recognize objects from any portion
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224, scale=(0.7, 1.0), ratio=(0.75, 1.33)),

    # Horizontal flip: cats and dogs look the same facing either direction
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),

    # Rotation: objects appear at various angles
    transforms.RandomRotation(degrees=15),

    # Perspective distortion: simulate different viewpoints
    transforms.RandomPerspective(distortion_scale=0.2, p=0.3),
])
```

**Note**: vertical flip is usually wrong for natural images — upside-down dogs are not a normal class.

## Standard color augmentations

```python
color_augmentations = transforms.Compose([
    # Jitter brightness, contrast, saturation, hue
    transforms.ColorJitter(
        brightness=0.3,   # multiply brightness by U(0.7, 1.3)
        contrast=0.3,
        saturation=0.3,
        hue=0.1,          # shift hue by ±0.1 of the color wheel
    ),

    # Random grayscale: forces learning non-color features
    transforms.RandomGrayscale(p=0.1),
])
```

## Standard augmentation pipeline (ImageNet recipe)

```python
IMAGENET_MEAN = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
IMAGENET_STD  = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

train_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.ColorJitter(0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.1),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(IMAGENET_MEAN, IMAGENET_STD),
])

# Validation: no augmentation — deterministic
val_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(IMAGENET_MEAN, IMAGENET_STD),
])
```

## Advanced augmentation techniques

### Mixup

Linearly interpolate between two training images and their labels:

$$
\tilde{x} = \lambda x_i + (1 - \lambda) x_j, \quad \tilde{y} = \lambda y_i + (1 - \lambda) y_j
$$

where $\lambda \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \alpha)$. This creates "mixed" images with soft labels. The model must learn smooth decision boundaries rather than hard ones. Effective for classification tasks with regularization benefits similar to label smoothing.

### CutMix

Replace a rectangular patch of image $i$ with the corresponding patch from image $j$, adjusting labels proportionally to the patch area:

$$
\tilde{y} = \lambda y_i + (1 - \lambda) y_j, \quad \lambda = \frac{\text{patch area}}{\text{image area}}
$$

CutMix forces the model to use all regions of the image (not just the most discriminative patch) and is empirically stronger than Mixup for fine-grained classification.

### Cutout / Random Erasing

Randomly mask a rectangular region with zeros or noise. Forces the model to make predictions even when parts of the object are occluded — important for real-world robustness.

### RandAugment

Automatically selects $N$ augmentation operations from a predefined set (rotate, shear, posterize, equalize, invert, etc.) with a single magnitude parameter $M$. Eliminates the need to tune individual augmentation probabilities.

```python
import torchvision.transforms as T

# RandAugment: N=2 operations, magnitude=9 (0-30 scale)
rand_augment = T.Compose([
    T.RandAugment(num_ops=2, magnitude=9),
    T.ToTensor(),
    T.Normalize(IMAGENET_MEAN, IMAGENET_STD),
])
```

### TrivialAugmentWide

A simpler variant of RandAugment that samples a random operation with a random magnitude independently for each image — no tuning required. Used in PyTorch's default training recipes for EfficientNet and RegNet.

## PyTorch implementation with Mixup and CutMix

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import numpy as np


def mixup_batch(images: torch.Tensor, labels: torch.Tensor,
                alpha: float = 0.4):
    """Mixup: blend two images and their labels."""
    lam = np.random.beta(alpha, alpha)
    batch_size = images.size(0)
    idx = torch.randperm(batch_size)

    mixed_images = lam * images + (1 - lam) * images[idx]
    labels_a, labels_b = labels, labels[idx]
    return mixed_images, labels_a, labels_b, lam


def mixup_criterion(criterion, pred, labels_a, labels_b, lam):
    """Compute Mixup loss: weighted combination of two CE losses."""
    return lam * criterion(pred, labels_a) + (1 - lam) * criterion(pred, labels_b)


def cutmix_batch(images: torch.Tensor, labels: torch.Tensor,
                 alpha: float = 1.0):
    """CutMix: paste a rectangular patch between two images."""
    lam = np.random.beta(alpha, alpha)
    batch_size, C, H, W = images.shape
    idx = torch.randperm(batch_size)

    # Random box coordinates
    cut_ratio = np.sqrt(1.0 - lam)
    cut_h = int(H * cut_ratio)
    cut_w = int(W * cut_ratio)
    cx = np.random.randint(W)
    cy = np.random.randint(H)

    x1 = max(cx - cut_w // 2, 0)
    y1 = max(cy - cut_h // 2, 0)
    x2 = min(cx + cut_w // 2, W)
    y2 = min(cy + cut_h // 2, H)

    mixed = images.clone()
    mixed[:, :, y1:y2, x1:x2] = images[idx, :, y1:y2, x1:x2]
    lam = 1 - (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1) / (H * W)

    return mixed, labels, labels[idx], lam

## When to apply augmentation

| Transform | Appropriate for | Not for |
|---|---|---|
| Horizontal flip | Animals, scenes, objects | Handwriting (B ↔ q), traffic signs |
| Vertical flip | Textures, satellite imagery | Natural images (sky ↑, ground ↓) |
| Random crop | Most image tasks | Medical images with precise localization |
| Color jitter | Natural images | X-rays, thermal images |
| Rotation | Objects that appear at any angle | OCR, document analysis |
| Mixup / CutMix | Classification | Detection/segmentation (complicates box labels) |

## Augmentation vs normalization

**Normalization** (mean/std subtraction) is not augmentation — it is a fixed deterministic preprocessing step applied to both train and val. **Augmentation** is random and applied only during training.

Always normalize. Whether to augment depends on dataset size: with large datasets (> 100K images per class), augmentation has diminishing returns because the natural variation in the dataset already provides diversity.

## Interview questions

<details>
<summary>Why is data augmentation applied only during training and not validation?</summary>

Validation is measuring how well the model performs on the true data distribution. If you augment validation images, you are measuring performance on a modified distribution, not the real one — the metric becomes meaningless. Augmentation is specifically a training-time tool to add diversity. The validation set should reflect the actual inference conditions exactly, using only deterministic preprocessing (resize, center crop, normalize).
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between Mixup and CutMix, and when does each work better?</summary>

Mixup blends entire images pixel-by-pixel: $\tilde{x} = \lambda x_i + (1-\lambda) x_j$. The result is a ghostly superimposed image. CutMix pastes a patch from one image into another, keeping the rest unchanged. CutMix preserves more realistic local structure — the model sees real image patches rather than blended pixels. Empirically, CutMix tends to outperform Mixup on fine-grained classification because the model must classify based on the visible patch, forcing it to use all regions of the image rather than just the most discriminative area.
</details>

## Common mistakes

- Applying augmentation to the validation set — always use `val_transform` without random operations for validation
- Using the same transform object for both train and val splits of a dataset after `random_split` — both will use train augmentation; create separate transform instances
- Over-augmenting: random flips + crop + rotation + color jitter + cutout + Mixup all at once can be too aggressive — the model's task becomes harder than the true task
- Forgetting normalization — augmentation without normalization leads to inconsistent input scales

## Final takeaway

Data augmentation is the most cost-effective regularizer for CNN training. The standard recipe (random crop, horizontal flip, color jitter, normalize) reduces overfitting significantly. For stronger regularization, Mixup, CutMix, and RandAugment provide additional gains. Always apply augmentation only to the training set, never to validation. The right augmentation strategy depends on the domain — domain knowledge about what transformations preserve the label is essential.
