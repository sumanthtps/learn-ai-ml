# What a CNN sees: filters and feature maps

Training a CNN is not a black box from the perspective of the feature maps. Each filter in each layer is a learned pattern detector. The feature map it produces shows where in the input that pattern was detected and how strongly. By visualizing filters and feature maps, we can understand what a CNN "pays attention to" at each layer — edges in layer 1, textures in layer 2, object parts in layer 3, whole objects in deeper layers.

## One-line definition

A CNN filter is a learned pattern detector. The feature map it produces is a heatmap showing where and how strongly that pattern appears in the input.

## Filters as pattern detectors

A single $3 \times 3$ filter with weights:

```
[[-1, -1, -1],
 [ 0,  0,  0],
 [ 1,  1,  1]]
```

produces high activation wherever there is a horizontal edge (bright below, dark above). This is a Sobel-like edge detector. When a CNN is trained, it learns exactly these kinds of filters — but optimized for the task, not hand-crafted.

**Layer 1 filters** in a trained CNN typically look like:
- Oriented edge detectors (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°)
- Color blob detectors
- Gabor-like frequency detectors

This is not by design — it is what gradient descent discovers because edges and blobs are the most informative low-level features in natural images.

## Feature map hierarchy

As depth increases, each feature map represents a more abstract concept:

| Layer depth | Typical feature maps |
|---|---|
| Layer 1 | Edges, corners, color boundaries |
| Layer 2 | Textures, simple curves |
| Layer 3 | Object parts (wheels, eyes, leaves) |
| Layer 4+ | Whole objects, semantic concepts |

This was demonstrated by Zeiler & Fergus (2013) who deconvolved ResNet features back to pixel space to visualize what each filter "cares about."

## What visualizations reveal about CNN learning

**Layer 1 (AlexNet/ResNet)**: Gabor-like edge detectors at multiple orientations. These emerge consistently across architectures trained on natural images — they are a universal starting point.

**Middle layers**: texture detectors, curve composites. The feature maps become increasingly coarse spatially (after pooling) but richer in semantic content.

**Late layers**: class-selective neurons. A neuron in ResNet layer 4 might fire strongly for "dog snout" patterns and barely activate for anything else.

**Grad-CAM**: shows that for a "dog" classification, the model focuses on the dog's face and body, not the background — evidence that the model is reasoning about the right features.

## Occlusion sensitivity

Systematically slide a gray square across the image and record the model's confidence drop:

```python
@torch.no_grad()
def occlusion_map(model, image_tensor, target_class, patch_size=32, stride=8):
    """
    Produce a heatmap where high values = important regions.
    Slides an occluding patch and measures confidence drop.
    """
    _, C, H, W = image_tensor.shape
    base_score = model(image_tensor).softmax(1)[0, target_class].item()

    scores = torch.zeros(H, W)
    for y in range(0, H - patch_size + 1, stride):
        for x in range(0, W - patch_size + 1, stride):
            occluded = image_tensor.clone()
            occluded[:, :, y:y+patch_size, x:x+patch_size] = 0.5
            score = model(occluded).softmax(1)[0, target_class].item()
            # High drop = this region was important
            scores[y:y+patch_size, x:x+patch_size] += (base_score - score)

    return scores.numpy()
```

## Interview questions

<details>
<summary>What do layer 1 filters of a CNN typically detect, and why?</summary>

Layer 1 filters in CNNs trained on natural images consistently learn edge detectors at multiple orientations (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°), color blob detectors, and Gabor-like frequency patterns. This is not programmed — it emerges from gradient descent on natural image datasets. Edges and color blobs are the most informative low-level statistics of natural images: the gradient of pixel intensity carries far more information than the raw intensity value. Every competitive CNN architecture, regardless of architecture choices, learns very similar layer 1 filters — suggesting these are the universally optimal features for natural image statistics.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is Grad-CAM and how does it work?</summary>

Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) visualizes which spatial regions of the input contributed most to a specific class prediction. It works by: (1) running a forward pass and recording the feature maps of a target convolutional layer; (2) computing the gradient of the class score with respect to those feature maps; (3) globally averaging the gradients to get a weight per feature map channel; (4) computing a weighted sum of the feature maps, ReLU'd to keep only positive contributions. The result is a coarse spatial heatmap showing which regions "mattered" for the prediction. Grad-CAM is useful for debugging: a model that highlights background rather than the object is using spurious correlations.
</details>

## Common mistakes

- Visualizing raw filter weights beyond layer 1 — deep layer filters are not interpretable as 2D images because they live in high-dimensional channel space
- Interpreting a feature map as "what the model sees" — it shows where a specific learned pattern was detected, not what the model holistically perceives
- Using Grad-CAM on ReLU-postprocessed activations — apply Grad-CAM to the pre-activation conv output for more accurate gradients

## Final takeaway

CNN filters are learned pattern detectors that form a hierarchy: edges → textures → parts → objects. Feature maps show where each detector fires across the input. Visualization tools — filter plotting, Grad-CAM, activation maximization, occlusion sensitivity — make this hierarchy inspectable, which is both intellectually satisfying and practically useful for debugging models that use the wrong features.
